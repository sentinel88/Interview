if endpoint sends request over ipv6 and we are bound on ipv4 only we will not receive that message itself because our port is not listening on ipv6
if our port is listening on ipv6 port we can reject the call
and in the reason header we can say 'try ipv4'
ASX is application server ... it can work as B2BUA as well.
Sip call can be either a 3PCC call or a B2BUA call.
Also it can work as a gateway as well.
In a 3PCC call, endpoint sends request to server via multiple proxy servers, and server is the last node in this call flow.
Like A is the first end point which sends INVITE and server is let's say D.
A --> B --> C --> D
here B and C are either gateway or proxy servers.
But response can only come from server which is D.
but in b2bua (back to back user agent) server becomes a middle man.
Here endpoints are two and server stands in between them.
Let's say A wants to communicate to C through sip server B
A --> B --> C
A <-- B <-- C
invite goes to B and in invite itself we mention C as the destination, So B will simply see the service as b2b and forwards the invite to C.
similarly C responds to the invite request and that reaches to B and B forwards the response to A
lockdown happens between A and C through B.
Application server is a server which receives the invite from endpoints and manages those calls, decides where the calls needs to be routed.
when you are using SIP protocol we call it an application server
when we use megaco we call it as a gateway.
