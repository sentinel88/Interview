Oracle Interview Questions:

Round1
	Discussion on the work done at Sandinve (Ud project) and INVASIC project at TUM. Understanding of the high level architecture, design etc. General technical discussion. why do we need LDAP here ? Motivation behind using directory based database.
Round2
	Duplicate a linkedlist having next & random pointers. LCA in binary tree. Missing integer in a file of integers from 0 - 4billion except one integer missing. Print output in a certain order using 2 threads. Question on whether virtual memory is needed if we have enough memory to accommodate all processes. Round robin scheduling drawbacks. Data consistency across 2 nodes when failover happens and a particular block is modified on one node but not on the other. When other node went down and starts up then it should first sync up with the other node and get all the metadata.
Round3
	Memory management scheme. Alloc and Deallocate Routine/Interface. Design and implement. Implement defragmentation. Give a list of offset ranges. How to store those offset ranges and then merge them as they arrive. Requires the usage of a balanced binary search tree and then we will need to check the overlap of these intervals and keep only 1 intervals after merging them with all. Once merged there should only be one interval left and others should be removed. Cases for alloc and dealloc should be considered.
Round4
	One problem on finding out the difference between 2 snapshots (2 sets of realm structures) Find the add and delete sets of realm. To 
	re create the same state on the other file system or replica node.
