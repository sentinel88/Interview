Where are literal constants stored ? 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21735890/where-and-how-are-constants-stored

Literal constants are stored in text segment as part of the instruction

Even constants like "const int i = 5" can be stored as part of the instructions if the compiler finds in the program, that there is no need for its address.
