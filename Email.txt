Hello Sudhendu,

How are you ??  Hope you have settled well in US now and your work is going good. 

I decided to leave Germany for professional and personal reasons. I moved back to bangalore a few days back and am now looking around for good opportunities here in product based companies.

I remember you mentioning about a new startup last time and I guess you were referring to Ranzure Networks. I see that they are actively hiring and feel it might be a really good opportunity to do a lot of hands on work in some interesting areas they have mentioned in case I get an opportunity. In case you can personally recommend me there at Ranzure to someone you know then it would be great. And, in case things still don't work out, I would then come to you just once more to take your help for forwarding my profile to your contacts in bangalore as you had mentioned.

Look forward to your email. I have also attached my updated resume.

regards,
Nishanth
