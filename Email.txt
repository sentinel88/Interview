Hello Sudhendu,

How are you ??  Hope you have settled well in US now and your work is going good. 

I decided to move back to India for professional and personal reasons. I came to bangalore on Oct 31 and am looking around for good opportunities in product based companies. I have started to apply at a few places.

I remember you mentioning about a new startup last time and I guess you were referring to Ranzure Networks. I see that they are actively hiring and feel it might be a good opportunity to work there. In case you can personally recommend me there at Ranzure to someone you know then it would be great. And, in case things still don't work out, I would then just trouble you one last time to take your help for forwarding my profile to your contacts in bangalore as you had mentioned last time.

Look forward to your email. I have also attached my updated resume.

regards,
Nishanth
