Hello Sudhendu,

How are you ??  Hope you have settled well in the US now and your work is going good. 

I decided to move back to India for professional and personal reasons and reached Bangalore on Oct 31. I was looking around for good opportunities in product based companies and will start applying soon in some of them.

I remember you mentioning about a new startup last time and I guess you were referring to Ranzure Networks. I had seen that they had posted lots of job openings earlier and hopefully there are still some left. Is it possible for you to recommend me at Ranzure to someone you know, that would be great. If things still don't work out, I would then just email you one more time to take your help for forwarding my profile to your contacts in bangalore as you had mentioned.

Hope this is ok for you and I look forward to your email. I have also attached my updated resume. In case you have any idea on what salary range I can expect from Ranzure, then please let me know. That would be very helpful in case I get a call and clear the interview. I am basically trying for jobs showing my 3 yrs exp + 1 yr in germany + masters degree. Currently, I have gathered some information from friends about the salary range in companies like Cisco, Juniper etc.

Thanks,
Nishanth
