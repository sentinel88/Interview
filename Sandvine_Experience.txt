            Round 6: Director: Just a personal discussion. Outside of resume.  Why back to India. Why sandvine. Which                                                              companies am I trying. All sorts of nonsense. (40min)

                                         Thoroughly grilled on my masters project. My prev work experience and masters project 
                                          have usually tackled scalability and performance problems. This is very important for networking 
                                         and telecom products so he asked everything related to that. How to do it ? Why ? Gave a 
                                          situation and how you will tackle it ? Why not mavenir? Why back to India ? Why sandvine ?
                                         What work do you like ? about myself ? What work excites you ? 2 difficult puzzles [ game show 
                                          with 3 doors, 2 having a donkey and one car. Improve your chances of getting the car above 1/3.                                                   Another puzzle on how we can perform arithmetic on infinite precision numbers. Convert 
                                         0.9999999999... to 1. Why does it never reach 1 and some other things. I did not solve both the                                                     puzzles :)  only partial answers. My brain was exhausted with so many rounds already]
